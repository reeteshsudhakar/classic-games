## tic-tac-toe
I'm currently learning Java, and used some basic methods in IntelliJ IDEA to create a game of tic tac toe. 
## blackjack
I love messing around with Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code, so I built a game of Blackjack using basic object oriented programming in Python. The game allows for minimum bets and the user can change the amount of money they start with to bet against the dealer - but the house **always** wins.
