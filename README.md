# Classic Random Games

## Tic-Tac-Toe \#
I'm currently learning Java, and used some basic methods in IntelliJ IDEA to create a game of tic tac toe with updated boards each turn from user inputs. Users can play multiple games and the games do validate winners based off board inputs.

## ♣ ♡ Blackjack ♢ ♠
I love messing around with Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code, so I built a game of Blackjack using basic object oriented programming in Python. The game allows for minimum bets and the user can change the amount of money they start with to bet against the dealer - but the house **always** wins. 

## Snake :snake:
Snake has been one of my favorite games to play whenever I open up my browser. I created this as an Applet a while back, but now the Applet API is deprecated. I'm hoping to update this in a different language soon, so stay tuned for more!
